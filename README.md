This is a wrapper for the [Nomi.ai PHP library](https://github.com/oliverearl/nomiai-php) for easy integration into
Laravel applications. [Nomi.ai](https://www.nomi.ai) is a companionship application that uses artificial intelligence.

You will need at least PHP 8.3 with the JSON extension, and Laravel 11 or above.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require oliverearl/nomiai-php-laravel
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="nomiai-php-laravel-config"
````

## Usage

To get started, you simply need to add your Nomi.ai API key to your `.env.` file under `NOMIAI_API_KEY`. You can also
provide a custom endpoint under `NOMIAI_ENDPOINT` if you need this functionality.

From here, you can access the Nomi.ai PHP library using its facade. Laravel will automatically use your default
HTTP library, however that might be configured.

```php
use \Nomiai\PhpSdk\Laravel\Facades\NomiAI;

/** @var array<int, \Nomiai\PhpSdk\Resources\Nomi> $nomis */
$nomis = NomiAI::getNomis();

$conversation = NomiAi::sendMessageToNomi(collect($nomis)->first(), 'Hello Nomi!');
```

Please check the PHP library documentation for more information on available functionality.

## Testing

Laravel Pint is used to maintain the PER coding style. The linter can be run using:

```bash
composer test
```

There are Pest architecture tests that also attempt to maintain certain conventions, including the use of strict typing 
where possible.
